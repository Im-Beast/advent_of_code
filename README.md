# Advent of Code
Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) made using Deno

## File scheme
`day_n.ts` - module for solving problem of day *n*

`day_n_input.ts` - input for *`day_n.ts`* module


## Missing days
Currently days 8 and 9 are missing.
Reasoning:
 - I'm really unhappy with the solutions
 - My current solutions for day 8 somehow worked for my input data however not for the example

Whenever I'll have time I'll rewrite them and push them here.
